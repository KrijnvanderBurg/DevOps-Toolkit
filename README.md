## 💡 What Makes This Different?

Many DevOps setups frustrate and fail because they treat local development and CI/CD as separate worlds. You format code locally with one tool, but the pipeline uses different configurations. You install dependencies one way in development, another in production. The result? **Misaligned local and CI/CD environments** with endless updating and debugging effort.

**This repository is an example implementation** that demonstrates a solution to this fundamental problem through a different architectural approach and repository structure: **perfect consistency everywhere**. It's not a tool or application itself, but rather a **working example** and **methodology showcase** that you can study, adapt, and copy for your own projects.

### 🎯 The Core Innovation: CI/CD Provider as Configuration Source of Truth

Instead of maintaining separate configurations for local and remote environments, this repository demonstrates a **CI/CD provider ownership** approach:

- **`.devcontainer/`** — Your local development environments with zero-configuration setup
- **`.github/`** — GitHub Actions workflows with configs in `.github/configs/`
- **`.azuredevops/`** — Multi-tier CI/CD pipeline templates with configs in `.azuredevops/configs/`

Each CI/CD provider maintains its own tool configurations (linters, formatters, security scanners, etc.) as the source of truth. DevContainers reference `.github/configs/` to match GitHub Actions locally, ensuring **exactly the same configuration files and CLI scripts** whether running locally or in GitHub Actions.

> **💡 Git Submodule Alternative:** While this repository uses a **monorepo approach**, the **git submodule pattern** (sharing a single `.dotfiles/` submodule across all environments) is equally valid and widely used. Choose based on whether you prefer:
> - **Monorepo**: Simpler management, per-provider flexibility, everything versioned together
> - **Submodules**: True single-source-of-truth, share configs across multiple repositories

### 🚀 What You'll Take Away

This **example repository** demonstrates a **proven approach** for restructuring DevOps workflows that bridges local and CI/CD environments through templating standardization. By studying and adapting this structure, you'll understand how to:

- **Architect consistency** across all environments using shared configuration and script submodules
- **Create predictable CI/CD outcomes** through identical local-remote tool execution
- **Scale DevOps practices** without losing quality or increasing complexity
- **Onboard teams quickly** with zero-configuration containerized environments

This isn't a tool to install—it's an **exploration and demonstration** of how modern DevOps consistency can be structured and work. **Copy what works, adapt what doesn't, and make it your own.**

> **🏗️ Architecture Note:** This repository demonstrates a **monorepo approach** with CI/CD providers (`.azuredevops/configs/`, `.github/configs/`) as configuration sources of truth. The **git submodule approach** (using a shared `.dotfiles/` submodule) is equally valid for teams wanting true single-source-of-truth across multiple repositories.

> **🚀 Ready for hands-on examples?** The [Azure DevOps Templates README](https://github.com/KrijnvanderBurg/.azuredevops) contains extensive documentation with real pipeline examples, parameter guides, and composition patterns.

## 🌟 Why This Approach Changes Your Way of Working

### Instant Environment Setup
Specialized DevContainers for Python development (20+ code quality tools) with complete Apache Spark clusters launch in moments. Every tool pre-configured, every extension ready, every quality gate in CI/CD active locally with zero effort.

> **🔍 See every detail:** The [DevContainer documentation](https://github.com/KrijnvanderBurg/.devcontainer) shows you exactly how this works—from container configuration to tool integration, with complete examples you can run yourself.

### Multi-Tier Template Patterns
Atomic templates serve as idempotent building blocks that compose into higher-level workflows like `linter.yaml`. Switch underlying tools anytime—as long as parameters match, everything continues working. Share these templates across all repositories to eliminate setup fragmentation.

25+ Azure DevOps templates representing real-world patterns: code formatting, security scanning, dependency analysis, automated testing—all battle-tested and ready to adapt.

> **⚙️ Go deeper into templates:** The [Azure DevOps Templates README](https://github.com/KrijnvanderBurg/.azuredevops) has comprehensive guides on atomic template design and composition patterns.

### Perfect Local-Remote Consistency
The CI/CD provider configuration architecture means your DevContainer runs `ruff --config .github/configs/python/pyproject.toml` and your GitHub Actions run the exact same command with the same config file. This transforms CI/CD from an unpredictable feedback mechanism into a reliable quality gate— when local checks pass, you can be confident about remote execution.

**Ready to dive deeper?** Explore the Azure DevOps and GitHub configurations in `.azuredevops/configs/` and `.github/configs/` to see how this pattern works.

> **🛠️ Alternative Pattern:** Many teams use a **shared `.dotfiles/` git submodule** instead of per-provider configs. Both approaches achieve consistency - choose based on your versioning and repository structure preferences.
