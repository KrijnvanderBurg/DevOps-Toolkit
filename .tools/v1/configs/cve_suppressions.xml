    <cve>CVE-2022-42969</cve>
  </suppress>
  <suppress>
    <notes>Pandas only used for testing, and function with vulnerability is not used. pandas through 1.0.3 can unserialize and execute commands from an untrusted file that is passed to the read_pickle() function, if __reduce__ makes an os.system call. NOTE: third parties dispute this issue because the read_pickle() function is documented as unsafe and it is the user's responsibility to use the function in a secure manner.</notes>
